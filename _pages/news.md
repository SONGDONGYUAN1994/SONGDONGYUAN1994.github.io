2023
- June 26th: I received the [UCLA Dissertation Year Fellowship](https://grad.ucla.edu/funding/financial-aid/funding-for-continuing-students/dissertation-year-fellowship/). Approximately 160 fellowships awarded under this program yearly (on average one for each Ph.D. program).

- May 15th: I received the [JXTX + CSHL 2023 Biology of Genomes Scholarship](https://jxtxfoundation.org/news/2022-12-16-bg/), which provides support to six outstanding graduate students in genomics and data sciences to attend the 2023 CSHL Biology of Genomes Conference. I gave a poster presentation about my newest work, scDesign3.
