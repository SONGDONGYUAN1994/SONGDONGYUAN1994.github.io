### R
- [ClusterDE](https://github.com/SONGDONGYUAN1994/ClusterDE): a post-clustering differential expression (DE) method robust to false-positive inflation caused by double dipping
- [PseudotimeDE](https://github.com/SONGDONGYUAN1994/PseudotimeDE): a robust method that accounts for the uncertainty in pseudotime inference and thus identifies DE genes along cell pseudotime with well-calibrated *p*-values
- [scDesign3](https://github.com/SONGDONGYUAN1994/scDesign3): an all-in-one single-cell data simulation tool by using reference datasets with different cell states (cell types, trajectories or and spatial coordinates), different modalities, and complex experimental designs
- [scPNMF](https://github.com/JSB-UCLA/scPNMF): a dimensionality reduction method to facilitate gene selection for targeted gene profiling by learning a sparse gene encoding of single cells

### Python
- [scSampler](https://github.com/SONGDONGYUAN1994/scsampler): a tool for fast diversity-preserving subsampling of large-scale single-cell transcriptomic data
